### Group openings

In the Atmospheric Turbulence Group at OU, you will work on cutting edge
research problems at the intersection of fluid mechanics and atmospheric
science. Our work encompasses:
- **Numerical simulations**: We use direct numerical simulation and large eddy
  simulation to study the physics of turbulent flows in the atmosphere. Our
  simulation-based work spans stably and unstably stratified atmospheric
  boundary layers, particle-laden flows, turbulent transport, and flows over
  complex surface topography and urban areas. 
- **Field observations**: We conduct field campaigns to obtain ground-truth
  data for evaluating theories and validating numerical simulations. 

For more information, check out [our papers](../publications) or [research
page](../research) to learn more.

<h4>Open Postdoctoral Scholar Position</h4> 
<h5> July 10, 2023</h5>

Update: This position has been filled. Please stay tuned for future opportunities. 

<!-- We have a current opening for a postdoctoral scholar, who will work in the -->
<!-- broad area of numerical modeling of turbulence in clouds. This position is -->
<!-- funded by a National Science Foundation grant which seeks to improve subgrid -->
<!-- scale models of interactions between turbulence and microphysical processes in -->
<!-- clouds. The successful candidate should hold a Ph.D. in atmospheric science, -->
<!-- meteorology, engineering, applied mathematics, computer science, or a closely -->
<!-- related field. They should also possess excellent written and oral -->
<!-- communication skills, and strong programming skills. Previous experience in -->
<!-- Fortran, MPI programming, and high performance computing is preferred. The -->
<!-- ideal candidate will also have previous research experience in turbulence, -->
<!-- cloud microphysics, and/or large eddy simulation. Salary will be competitive -->
<!-- and commensurate with experience and will include the generous OU benefits -->
<!-- package. --> 

<!-- Interested applicants should send a cover letter detailing how they fit the -->
<!-- required and preferred qualifications, a current CV, a list of three or more -->
<!-- professional references, and a summary of recent work and research interests. -->
<!-- All applications should be submitted electronically in a single PDF document to -->
<!-- [Prof. Salesky](mailto:salesky@ou.edu). This appointment is for one year, and -->
<!-- may be renewed for a second year pending satisfactory research performance. The -->
<!-- start date will be in early fall of 2023, or early if at all possible. Review -->
<!-- of applications will begin immediately and will continue until the position is -->
<!-- filled. -->

<h4>Prospective Graduate Students (M.S. or Ph.D.)</h4>

If you are interested in joining us for your M.S. or Ph.D., feel free to
[contact Dr. Salesky](mailto:salesky@ou.edu) to discuss your research interests
and funding availability. The School of Meteorology has helpful online
resources for [prospective graduate
students](https://meteorology.ou.edu/academics/prospective-graduate/) that
provide information about the [application
process](http://meteorology.ou.edu/academics/prospective-graduate/how-to-apply/).
We are located in the [National Weather Center](https://www.ou.edu/nwc) on OU's
research campus, which houses the OU School of Meteorology, together with state
and federal research units.   

While an undergraduate degree in meteorology or atmospheric science is
beneficial for prospective graduate students, I also consider applicants with
backgrounds in physics, engineering, computer science, applied mathematics, and
other branches of the physical sciences.
