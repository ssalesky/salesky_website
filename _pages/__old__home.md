### Welcome!

Welcome to the homepage of the atmospheric turbulence research group in the 
School of Meteorology at the University of Oklahoma. 

Turbulence transport of momentum, heat, water vapor, greenhouse gases, and
particulate matter in the lowest part of the atmosphere is critical for many
processes in the Earth system. Despite its importance, turbulence has sometimes
been called "the last unsolved problem of classical physics" due to the
nonlinearity of the governing equations. Research in our group focuses on
advancing the fundamental knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the
atmospheric boundary layer, turbulence, and interactions between Earth's
surfaace and the atmosphere. We use observations, numerical simulations, and
theory to address scientific questions of importance for weather, climate,
hydrology, air quality, and human health. 

Recent topics of interest in our group include the structure and dynamics of
convective and stable boundary layers, scalar transport (focusing on heat and
moisture), and particle laden flows (with an emphasis on snow transport and
cloud turbulence). A main focus of our research is developing models of these
physical processes in large eddy simulation which are faithful to the
underlying physics. 

### About me


<!-- Theoretical physics is a branch of physics that focuses on the development of mathematical models and theories to understand and explain natural phenomena. -->
<!-- It plays a crucial role in our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe and the fundamental particles that make up all matter. -->
<!-- Research in theoretical physics helps us to make predictions about how the universe works and to test these predictions through experiments. -->
<!-- It also helps us to understand the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy, and to explore the limits of our current knowledge. -->
<!-- Theoretical physics helps us to make progress in a wide range of fields, including cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, and it has led to many important discoveries and technological innovations. -->

<!-- I am a physicist working in the field of quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics. -->

<!-- I received my undergraduate degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1939 and went on to earn my PhD from Princeton University in 1942. -->
<!-- After completing my doctoral studies, I worked on the Manhattan Project, where I helped develop the first atomic bombs. -->
<!-- After the war, I returned to academia, holding teaching and research positions at Cornell and now the California Institute of Technology. -->
